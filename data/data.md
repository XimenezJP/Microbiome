# Background on the data
In this example I use the publicly available data from a study on colorectal cancer:

[**Genomic analysis identifies association of Fusobacterium with colorectal carcinoma**](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/22/2/292.long). Kostic, A. D., Gevers, D., Pedamallu, C. S., Michaud, M., Duke, F., Earl, A. M., et al. (2012). **Genome research**, 22(2), 292-298.

As a side-note, this work was published ahead of print in [**Genome Research**](http://genome.cshlp.org/) alongside a highly-related article from a separate group of researchers (long-live reproducible observations!): [**Fusobacterium nucleatum infection is prevalent in human colorectal carcinoma**](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/22/2/299.long). In case you are interested.

### Data source, from methods section in article:

> The 16S gene data set consists of 454 FLX Titanium sequences spanning the V3 to V5 variable regions obtained for 190 samples (95 pairs). Detailed protocols used for 16S amplification and sequencing are available on the HMP Data Analysis and Coordination Center website.

### Study Abstract:

> The tumor microenvironment of colorectal carcinoma is a complex community of genomically altered cancer cells, nonneoplastic cells, and a diverse collection of microorganisms. Each of these components may contribute to carcino genesis; however, the role of the microbiota is the least well understood. We have characterized the composition of the microbiota in colorectal carcinoma using whole genome sequences from nine tumor/normal pairs. Fusobacterium sequences were enriched in carcinomas, confirmed by quantitative PCR and 16S rDNA sequence analysis of 95 carcinoma/normal DNA pairs, while the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla were depleted in tumors. Fusobacteria were also visualized within colorectal tumors using FISH. These findings reveal alterations in the colorectal cancer microbiota; however, the precise role of Fusobacteria in colorectal carcinoma pathogenesis requires further investigation.
